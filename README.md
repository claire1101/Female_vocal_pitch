# Female_vocal_pitch
Replication materials for a study on the effect of vocal pitch on the electability of female politicians in Ireland's 2024 General Election. 

There are two python scripts, one for vocal pitch extraction and one for data analysis. 

There are four main data files:
* pitch_results.csv is the output from the vocal pitch extraction
* female_candidates_cleaned.csv contains data on all of the female candidates
* female_candidates_with_optional_pitch.csv has data on all of the candidates, including vocal pitch data
* audio_data.csv has information on where and what type of audio data was sourced for each candidate

And there are 43 zip files (one per consitutency) with audio recordings for each candidate
